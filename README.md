This repository follows best practices for professional machine learning projects. Be sure to follow the instructions carefully to ensure a seamless workflow.

---

### üéØ Goals  
- Understand and implement fundamental machine learning algorithms.  
- Develop workflows for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.  
- Utilize professional coding practices, including virtual environments and version control.  
- Optimize ML models for performance and interpretability.  
- Implement machine learning solutions to real-world datasets.  

---

## ‚ö° Technologies Used  
- **Python 3.11+**: Core programming language for ML development.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment for data analysis.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical computing.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization tools for exploratory data analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Requirements  

### üìù Installation and Setup  
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/applied-ml-course.git
   cd applied-ml-course
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
